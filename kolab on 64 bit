Setup is now going to set up the 389 Directory Server. This may take a little
while (during which period there is no output and no progress indication).

Shutting down dirsrv:

Please supply a Cyrus Administrator password. This password is used by Kolab to

To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h centkolab.bmts.us password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
/usr/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:
cd /usr ; /usr/bin/mysqld_safe &

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd /usr/mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems with the /usr/bin/mysqlbug script!

Please supply a root password for MySQL. This password will be the administrative
user for this MySQL server, and it should be kept a secret. After this setup
process has completed, Kolab is going to discard and forget about this password,
but you will need it for administrative tasks in MySQL.

Please supply a password for the MySQL user 'kolab'. This password will be used
by Kolab services, such as the Web Administration Panel.
