System Requirements:


WARNING: iRedMail is designed to be deployed on a FRESH server system, which means your server does NOT have mail related components installed,
e.g. MySQL, OpenLDAP, Postfix, Dovecot, Amavisd, etc (iRedMail will install and configure them for you automatically). Otherwise it may override your existing files/configurations althought it will backup files before modifing, and it may be not working as expected.

To install iRedMail, you need:

A FRESH, working RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux system. Supported releases are listed on page Features of iRedMail.
At least 1GB of memory is required for production use. if you have less memory, you have to disable spam/virus scanning by following our wiki tutorial. WARNING: It's strongly recommended to enable spam/virus scanning for production use, so please go get at least 1GB memory for your mail server.

Preparations:

Set a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) hostname on your server

Enter command 'hostname -f' to view the current hostname:

$ hostname -f

mx.example.com

On RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux, hostname is set in two files:

/etc/sysconfig/network: hostname setting

# Part of file: /etc/sysconfig/network
HOSTNAME=mx.example.com

    /etc/hosts: hostname <=> IP address mapping. Warning: List the FQDN hostname as first item.

# Part of file: /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   mx.example.com demo localhost localhost.localdomain

Verify the FQDN hostname. If it wasn't changed, please reboot server to make it work.

$ hostname -f
mx.example.com

Enable yum repositories for installing new packages:

    For CentOS or Scientific Linux, please enable CentOS/Scientific official yum repositories, and DISABLE all third-party yum repositories to avoid package conflict.
    For Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please enable Red Hat Network to install packages, or create a local yum repository with DVD/CD ISO images.
